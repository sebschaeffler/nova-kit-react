## ‚≠êÔ∏è - Background story

The name was inspired by the concept of a "nova" ‚Äì a
stellar explosion that signifies a powerful and luminous burst of energy against
the dark backdrop of space. Just as a nova illuminates the cosmos, our library
aims to shine a light on best practices, modern sleek components and shared
layouts & utilities. <br />

Nova is a React-based library. The concept of a "Supernova" ‚Äì an even more powerful and transformative event - can transcend its initial form.
In the future the transition from Nova Kit to Supernova Kit could mark a pivotal moment in our journey by introducing a technology-agnostic library that can be used across different platforms.
